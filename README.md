# Coding-Challenge-4

In this Coding Challenge, I was tasked with creating an inventory management system for a small business, checking the storage of products, calculating the stock levels, checkingfor low inventory, and tracking sales. This was accomplished using an array of objects to store the data and various functions to manipulate the data.
